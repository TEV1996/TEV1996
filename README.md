<p>Hey, and welcome to my porfolio ! The projects that are stored in it are based on a variety of fields such as Data Engineering, Machine Learnning, Data Science, and some Web Development. I'm self taught, and I've been learning from various sources such as Coursea, Udemy, Edx, Kaggle, Freecodecamp, Datacamp ,and so much more. The purpose of this portfolio is to connect with others in the same field, and potential recuiters looking for new talent to bring in. I divided up my portfolio into sections, and organized them  by what I started off learning with to what I'm currently working on now. I've worked on many projects but I always keep pushing to learn as much as I can, beccause in my opinion you can never learn enough.</p>
